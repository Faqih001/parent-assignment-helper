# Admin System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the admin system for managing custom plans and users.

## Database Setup

1. **Run the Migration Script**
   - Open your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL script in `admin_setup_migration.sql`
   - This will create the necessary tables and policies

2. **Create Your First Admin User**
   - Register normally through the app with your admin email
   - In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
   ```

## Admin Features

## Admin Dashboard Access

Once you're an admin user:
1. Log in to your account

## API Endpoints

The system uses these database helper functions:
- `createCustomPlan()` - Create new custom plans

- `deleteCustomPlan()` - Remove plans
- `getCustomPlans()` - Fetch active plans
- `getAllUsers()` - Get all user profiles
- `updateUserPlan()` - Change user's plan
- `makeUserAdmin()` - Grant admin privileges

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for custom plans
2. **Question Limits**: Set appropriate limits based on customer needs
3. **Pricing**: Ensure pricing reflects value and costs
4. **Features**: List specific features customers receive
5. **Admin Access**: Only grant admin access to trusted users
6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and update plans

## Troubleshooting
